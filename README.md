## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a pretty straight forward challenge requiring HTML and CSS. Utilised grid and flexbox to deal with a few layout challenges. Mobile first approach really helped. The figma design file was a bit strange for this challenge but I guess this is part of the game.

### Continued development

I need to be more efficient with writing my code.
